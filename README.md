# CCTaskManagementAndScheduler
Planner and scheduler task management system using C++, CMake, QT and MySQL

Over my career as a software engineer, I have found it helpful to use planners to schedule my time. First there were the paper planner from Daytimer. This was helpful to plan my time around meetings and appointments as well as keep some very brief notes. The drawback with this system was that I could not record goals or prioritize tasks.

I move on to the Franklin Covey planner system which provided a system for laying out goals, prioritizing tasks on a daily basis and managing meetings and appointments as well as more space for notes. The drawback with this system was that it did not easily provide for multi-person software development projects when I had to manage projects. It was also not electronic in the era of PDAs and cell phones. I continued to use the Franklin Covey system but also to use Microsoft Project and Microsoft Outlook.

I still haven’t found an electronic system to merge all the features of the Franklin Covey paper planner with Microsoft Project and Outlook. My iPhone does the job of the Daytimer paper planner, but there is no way to prioritize tasks or align those tasks with goals. There are now much better project planning tools than Microsoft Project coupled with Outlook or Microsoft Exchange Server. Most or all Product Lifecycle Management tools ignore the smaller side of personal time management. As far as I know, Franklin Covey never extended their tools to include project management and their software didn’t work the same as the paper planner.
